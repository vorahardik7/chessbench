The pawns on g6 and h7 (though h7 is the King's current square, the pawn on g6 blocks the diagonal escape) and the pawn on f7 restrict the King's movement. The Black Queen on a4 is too far away to assist in defense.\n\n**Tactical Theme:**\nCorridor Mate (Back Rank Mate variation).\n\n**Solution:**\nWhite delivers a checkmate in two moves.\n1.  **Qe6+**: The Queen moves to e6, delivering a check along the 6th rank. This forces the Black King to move.\n2.  **...Kh8**: The King has no other squares to go to (g8 is covered by the Queen, f8 is covered by the Queen's control of the diagonal, and the 6th rank is blocked by White's Queen). The King is forced to h8.\n3.  **Qf8#**: The Queen moves to f8, delivering checkmate.

It does *not* attack h2 directly.\n        *   However, the Black Queen on b1 controls the b-file and the 1st rank.\n        *   Wait, let's look at the White King's safety. King on h2. Pawns on g2, h3 (Black pawn).\n        *   The Black Knight on g3 attacks f1, h1, e2, e4, f5, h5.\n        *   The Black Queen on b1 attacks the 1st rank.\n        *   If it were Black's turn, Qb1-h1# would be mate? Let's check. King on h2. Pawn on g2 blocks h1? No, h1 is empty. Qb1-h1 is check. King can go to g3? No, Knight on g3. King can take Queen? No, protected by Bishop on b3? No, Bishop on b3 doesn't protect h1. But wait, the King is on h2. If Qh1+, Kg3 is blocked by Knight. Kh3 is blocked by Black Pawn on h3. So Qh1# is a threat.\n        *   White must move immediately to prevent mate or deliver their own.\n\n2.  **Search for White's Mate in 2:**\n    *   White has a Queen on b6 and a Bishop on b4.\n    *   Black King is on e7.\n    *   The Black King is boxed in.\n        *   Rank 8: Rook on a8.\n        *   Rank 7: King on e7, Pawn on f7, Bishop on g7.\n        *   Rank 6: Queen on b6, Pawn on c6, Pawn on h6.\n    *   Let's look at checks for White.\n    *   **Queen moves from b6:**\n        *   Qb7+? King is on e7. Qb7 attacks e7. But Pawn on f7 protects b7? No, f7 is on the 7th rank. b7 is on the 7th rank. The pawn on f7 protects e7, g7, e6, f6, g6. It does not protect b7.\n        *   Wait, let's check the board again.\n            *   Rank 7: `4kpb1` -> e7=k, f7=p, g7=b.\n            *   Rank 6: `1Q1p3p` -> b6=Q, d6=p, h6=p.\n        *   If Qb7+, the King is on e7. The Queen is on b7. The King cannot take the Queen (distance is too far? No, b7 to e7 is 3 squares. King moves 1 square).\n        *   So Qb7+ is check.\n        *   Where can the King go?\n            *   e8: Occupied by nothing? Rank 8 is `r7...`. a8=r. e8 is empty. But Qb7 controls the 7th rank. So Ke8 is valid escape?\n            *   Wait, Qb7 attacks the 7th rank. e7 is the King's square. The King is in check. He must move.\n            *   Squares around e7:\n                *   d8: Empty.\n                *   e8: Empty.\n                *   f8: Empty.\n                *   d7: Empty.\n                *   f7: Occupied by own pawn.\n                *   d6: Occupied by own pawn.\n                *   e6: Empty.\n                *   f6: Empty.\n            *   If Qb7+, the Queen covers the entire 7th rank (a7-h7). So the King cannot stay on the 7th rank.\n            *   The King must move to the 8th rank (d8, e8, f8) or 6th rank (d6 is blocked, e6, f6).\n            *   Is there a follow-up mate?\n    *",

The immediate threat is discovered check or direct attack. The tactical theme involves a double attack and a mating net.\n\nWhite starts with **Qd8+**. This is a double check (from the Queen and the discovered check from the c6 pawn), forcing the Black King to move to a7, as capturing the Queen on d8 is impossible due to the protection from the c6 pawn.\n\nAfter **Ka7**, White delivers the final blow with **Qb6#**. The Queen covers the a7 square and the escape squares on the 7th rank, while the King on g3 and pawns on c3 and f4 restrict other avenues. The Black pieces on b1 and e1 are too far away to help.\n\n[RESULT] d5d8 b8a7 d8b6[/RESULT]",
