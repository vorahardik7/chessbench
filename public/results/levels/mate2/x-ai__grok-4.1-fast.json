White can deliver a forcing checkmate in 2 moves by first checking with the queen to control black's king escapes and clear the path for the rook.\n\n### Tactical Theme\n**Clearance sacrifice/check**: Qe2-h5 checks the king, simultaneously vacating e2 (clearing rank 2 for rook travel) and dominating key squares around the black king (g6, h6, h8). Black's *only* legal reply is Kg8. Then Rb2-b8 invades the 8th rank for mate, as the king is trapped with no safe flights, captures, or blocks possible.\n\n### Forcing Checkmate Sequence\n1. **Qe2-h5+** Queen checks along the h-file (path clear). Black king cannot capture (not adjacent), and no captures/interpositions possible. Legal king moves: only g8 (h6/g6/h8 attacked by Qh5; g7 blocked).\n2. Black **Kh7-g8** (forced).\n3. **Rb2-b8#** Rook slides up open b-file to 8th rank, checking along empty rank 8. Black king trapped (f8/h8 attacked by rook, h7 by queen; f7/g7 own pawns). No captures/blocks/interpositions.\n\nVerified: All other black first replies illegal; b8 undefended and mates.\n\n[RESULT] e2h5 h7g8 b2b8 [/RESULT]",
