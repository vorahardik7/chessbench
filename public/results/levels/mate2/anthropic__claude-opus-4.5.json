The knight on h3 is also well-placed near the White king.\n\nLet me consider **Qh1+**:\n- After Qh1+, White king must move (Ke2 is blocked by the rook, so Kf2 or Kg2)\n- If Kf2, then Qg1# (checkmate - queen protected by knight on h3)\n- If Kg2, then Qg1# (checkmate - queen protected by knight on h3)\n\nWait, let me verify Kf2 after Qh1+:\n- After Qh1+, Kf2, then Qg1+ - the king is on f2, queen on g1 gives check. The knight on h3 protects g1. Is this mate? King can't go to e2 (rook there), can't go to f3 (queen controls), can't stay on f2 (in check). Actually Ke2 is possible since it's White's own rook. Let me reconsider.\n\nAfter Qh1+, Kf2, Qg1#:\n- King on f2, queen on g1 gives check\n- Ke2 - blocked by own rook? No, the king can capture or the rook is there... the rook is on e2, so Ke2 is not possible\n- Kf3 - queen controls f3? No, from g1 the queen doesn't control f3\n- Ke3 - queen controls e3? No wait, White's queen is on e3\n\nLet me reconsider. After Qh1+:\n- Kf2, Qg1# - King on f2, queen on g1. Knight on h3 protects g1. King can't go to e2 (rook), e3 (own queen), f3 (queen on g1 doesn't cover f3 directly but knight on h3 doesn't either)... \n\nActually Kf3 might be possible. Let me check if Qg1 covers f3 - no, g1 to f3 is not a queen move pattern.\n\nLet me try **Qg1+** first:\n- Qg1+, Kxg1 (forced), Nf2# - double check? No, just knight check. King can go to f1, h1, h2...\n\nLet me try **Nf2+** (knight fork/check):\n- Nf2+ is check to the king on f1\n- Kxf2 (or Ke1), then Qg1#?\n- If Kxf2, Qg1# - is this mate? King on f2, queen on g1. Ke2 blocked by rook, Ke3 blocked by own queen, Kf3 available? Queen on g1 doesn't cover f3...\n\nActually, let me try **Qg1+**:\n- Qg1+, Ke2 (only legal move since Kxg1 allows Nf2#)\n- After Ke2, Qf2# - queen on f2 gives check, king can't escape (d1, d3 covered by queen, e1 covered, e3 has own queen)\n\nLet me verify: Qg1+, Ke2, Qf2#\n- King on e2, queen on f2 is check\n- Kd1 - queen covers d1? Yes\n- Kd3 - queen covers d3? Yes  \n- Ke1 - blocked by queen on f2? No... wait, Qf2 doesn't block e1 directly but does it give check from f2 to e1? No.\n\nHmm, let me try: Qg1+, Ke2, Qxe3#? No, that's not check.\n\nBack to Qg1+, Kxg1, Nf2# - this is checkmate! King on g1, knight on f2 gives check, and h1, h2, g2 are all covered.\n\n[RESULT]h2g1 f1g1 h3f2[/RESULT]",

The queen on d2 and rook on c2 are well-placed for attacking the white king.\n\n**Key tactical ideas:**\n1. Qd1+ would be check, but Ra1 blocks\n2. Qxf2+ - this is check! King must respond\n\nLet me analyze **1...Qxf2+**:\n- If 2.Kh1, then Qxg2# (checkmate - queen takes bishop with mate)\n- If 2.Kxf2, then Rc1 threatens but let me check... actually after Kxf2, Black needs a quick mate\n\nWait, let me reconsider. After 1...Qxf2+ 2.Kh1:\n- 2...Qxg2# is checkmate (queen protected by rook on c2)\n\nAfter 1...Qxf2+ 2.Kxf2:\n- 2...Rc1 and White's rook on a1 can take... not immediate mate\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\n**1...Qd1+!**\n- 2.Rxd1 Rxg2# (rook takes bishop with checkmate - king can't escape)\n- 2.Bf1 Qxf1# (checkmate)\n\nWait, after 2.Rxd1, then 2...Rxg2+ 3.Kf1 and it's not mate yet.\n\nLet me reconsider **1...Qxf2+**:\n- 2.Kh1 Qxg2# ✓ (Queen on g2, protected by Rc2, king has no escape)\n- 2.Kxf2 Rc1! threatens Rf1#, but White has Rxc1... \n\nActually after 2.Kxf2 Rc1, White plays 3.Rxc1 and no mate.\n\nLet me try **1...Rc1+!**\n- 2.Rxc1 Qd1+ (discovered or direct)\n- Wait, 2.Rxc1 Qxf2+ 3.Kh1 Qf1#? No, Rxf1.\n\nLet me try **1...Qf4!** threatening Qf1#\n- If 2.gxf4 Rc1+ 3.Bf1 Rxf1#\n\nActually, let me reconsider **1...Qxf2+ 2.Kh1 Qf1+!**\n- 3.Bxf1 Rxf1# - but wait, Rxf1 also works\n\nAfter 1...Qxf2+ 2.Kh1 Qxg2# is indeed checkmate because:\n- King on h1, Queen on g2, Rook on c2 protects g2\n- King cannot escape to f1 (queen controls), h2 blocked by pawn structure\n\nSo the solution is:\n1...Qxf2+ 2.Kh1 Qxg2#\n\n[RESULT] d2f2 g1h1 f2g2 [/RESULT]",
