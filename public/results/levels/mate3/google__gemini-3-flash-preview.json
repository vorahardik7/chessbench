Black's king on d5 and pawn on d4 control critical squares (e4, c4, e3, c3), limiting the White king's mobility.\n2. The White king is currently on d2. Black can use the rooks to check the king and force it towards the edge or into a mating net.\n3. The move **1... Rf2+** forces the White king to move. If White plays **2. Ke1**, Black follows with **2... Rh1#**.\n4. If White plays **2. Kc1**, Black plays **2... Rh1+**. White's only legal response is to block with the rook: **3. Rd1**.\n5.
