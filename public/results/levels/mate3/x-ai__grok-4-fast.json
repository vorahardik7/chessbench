      "rawOutput": "### Analysis\nThe position shows a powerful rook battery on the e-file, with White's rooks on e1 and e5 targeting the Black rook on e8. The e8 rook is protected by the rook on b8 (along the 8th rank) and the bishop on b5 (along the diagonal). White's queen on g5 eyes the 8th rank, and the bishop on h6 supports key squares near the king. Black's king on g8 is vulnerable on the open kingside, with limited escape squares (f8 attacked by the bishop, g7 attacked by the bishop, f7 potentially covered). The black queen on c2 is out of play and distracting, but irrelevant to the tactic. The opponent's last move (d8e8) placed the rook on e8, completing the target for the battery.\n\nThe tactical theme is a **rook battery with clearance and final pin**. White sacrifices the rooks to clear the e-file and force Black's protectors to recapture, positioning the bishop on e8. This blocks Black's own escape and sets up the queen to deliver a pinning check on the 8th rank, where the bishop cannot move without exposing the king, resulting in checkmate.\n\n### Forcing Checkmate Sequence\nWhite starts with Re5xe8+, forcing Black to recapture (best is Rb8xe8, as B b5xe8 allows similar continuation with tempo loss). White then recaptures with Re1xe8+, forcing the second recapture (Bb5xe8). White's third move Qg5-d8 pins the bishop on e8 to the king along the 8th rank (path f8 empty), checking the king. The bishop cannot capture the queen (pinned), the king has no safe squares (f8/g7 attacked by Bh6, h8/f7 blocked or attacked by the queen), and no other pieces can resolve the check, leading to mate.\n\n[RESULT] e5e8 b8e8 e1e8 b5e8 g5d8 [/RESULT]",
