Wait, looking at the FEN, the Black King is on h2. The previous move mentioned is \"g3h2\". This implies the King moved to h2.\n    *   **Goal:** Find a mate in 1 for White.\n\n2.  **Identify Tactical Theme:**\n    *   The Black King is on h2.\n    *   The White Queen is on g5.\n    *   The White King is on f1.\n    *   The Black King is cornered on the edge of the board (h-file, 2nd rank).\n    *   Let's look for checks.\n    *   **Candidate 1:** Qg5-h5+? No, the King is on h2. Qh5+ is not a check.\n    *   **Candidate 2:** Qg5-g2+? The King is on h2. Qg2+ attacks h2. Can the King move?\n        *   Squares around h2: g1, g2, g3, h1, h3.\n        *   g1: Occupied by White King? No, White King is on f1. Is g1 attacked? White King is on f1, so g1 is covered by the White King.\n        *   g2: Occupied by the Queen delivering the check.\n        *   g3: Empty. Is it attacked? White King is on f1. The King attacks f2, g2, g1. It does *not* attack g3. However, the Queen on g2 attacks g3.\n        *   h1: Empty. Is it attacked? White King on f1 attacks f2, g2, g1. It does *not* attack h1. The Queen on g2 attacks h1.\n        *   h3: Empty. Is it attacked? The Queen on g2 attacks h3.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the King's escape squares if Qg2+ is played.\n        *   King is on h2.\n        *   White plays Qg2+.\n        *   King cannot go to g2 (occupied by Queen).\n        *   King cannot go to h1 (covered by Queen on g2).\n        *   King cannot go to h3 (covered by Queen on g2).\n        *   King cannot go to g3 (covered by Queen on g2).\n        *   King cannot go to g1 (covered by White King on f1).\n    *   So, Qg2# looks like mate.\n\n3.  **Verify other checks:**\n    *   Qg5-h4+?

No check.\n\n4.  **Confirm the move:**\n    *   White Queen is on g5.\n    *   Target square is g2.\n    *   Move: g5g2.\n    *   Result: Checkmate.\n\n5.  **Format Output:**\n    *   Analysis: White has a forced mate in one. The Black King is on h2. The White Queen on g5 can move to g2, delivering check. The King has no escape squares: g1 is covered by the White King on f1, and h1, h3, g3 are covered by the Queen on g2. The square g2 is occupied by the Queen. Therefore, it is mate.\n    *   Theme: Queen checkmate / King hunt / Corridor mate.\n    *   UCI: g5g2.\n\n6.  **Final check:**\n    *   FEN: 8/p6p/1p6/3P2Q1/2P5/1q3p2/7k/5K2 w - - 4 55\n    *   White to move.\n    *   Qg5 -> g2.\n    *   Is g2 blocked? No.\n    *   Is it safe? The Black Queen is on b3. Does it attack g2?\n        *   b3 to g2 is a diagonal (b3-c4-d5-e6-f7-g8). No.\n        *   b3 to g2 is a knight's move? No.\n        *   b3 to g2 is a file/rank? No.\n        *   Wait, b3 is (file 2, rank 3). g2 is (file 7, rank 2).\n        *   Diagonals from b3: a2, c4, d5, e6, f7, g8. And a4, c2.\n        *   So b3 does not attack g2.\n    *   Does the Black pawn on f3 attack g2? No, pawns capture diagonally forward. f3 captures on e2 and g2.\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Black has a pawn on f3.\n    *   If White plays Qg2+, the pawn on f3 captures the Queen on g2 (fxg2).\n    *   Let's re-read the board carefully.\n    *   FEN: ... 1q3p2 ... (Rank 3: . q . . . p . .) -> Pawn is on f3.\n    *   If Qg2+, then fxg2.\n    *   So Qg2 is NOT mate.\n\n    *   Let's look for other moves.\n    *   White Queen on g5.\n    *   Black King on h2.\n    *   Black Pawn on f3.\n    *   Black Queen on b3.\n    *   White King on f1.\n\n    *   Is there another check?\n    *   Qg5-h5?
