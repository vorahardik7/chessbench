White can deliver a decisive check from which Black has no escape.\n\nThe winning move is for the White rook to move to c2. This places the Black king in check. The king cannot move to any adjacent square as they are all controlled by the White king. The rook on c2 cannot be captured by the Black king because it is defended by the White king. No other Black piece can capture the rook or block the check. This results in an immediate checkmate.\n\n[RESULT]h2c2[/RESULT]",
