Black has a queen on b3 and various pawns, but they are not relevant to the immediate checkmate.\n\nThe tactical theme is a **back-rank checkmate**, but in this case, it's a discovered checkmate. The white queen on g5 is aligned with the black king on h2. The key is to move the white king to create a discovered check from the queen that also happens to be checkmate.\n\nThe only move that achieves this is **Kf1-e1**. When the king moves from f1 to e1, it uncovers (discovers) an attack from the queen on g5 to the king on h2. Since the king has no legal moves (all adjacent squares are either off the board or attacked by the queen), and no piece can block or capture the queen, it is checkmate.\n\n[RESULT] f1e1 [/RESULT]",

White has a queen on d5 and a knight on e5, both attacking squares around the black king. The key observation is that the black king is very exposed and lacks safe squares.\n\n**Tactical Theme:** Checkmate - The black king is trapped on e7 with no escape squares. The knight on e5 controls d7 and f7, while the queen on d5 can deliver a check that covers the remaining squares.\n\n**Forcing Checkmate Sequence:**\n\nWhite can deliver checkmate in one move by moving the queen to d6. This move attacks the king (check) and covers all potential escape squares (d7, e6, f6). The king cannot capture the queen because it is protected by the knight on e5.

White's rook is on h2.\n\n**Tactical Theme:** Checkmate\n\n**Finding the Mate:**\nWhite has a forced checkmate in one move. The key is to deliver a check that the Black king cannot escape. The Black king on c1 is very restricted. The rook on h2 can move to deliver a check along the first rank.\n\nLooking at the squares around the Black king:\n- c1: occupied by king\n- d1: attacked by White's king on e3\n- d2: attacked by White's king on e3  \n- c2: attacked by White's pawn on c4\n- b1: the only safe square, but it's blocked by the b3 pawn\n\nThe rook can deliver checkmate by moving to c2 (Rc2#) because:\n1. It gives check to the king on c1\n2. The king cannot move to d1 or d2 (controlled by White's king)\n3. The king cannot move to b1 (blocked by the b3 pawn)\n4. The king cannot capture the rook (rook is protected by the c4 pawn)\n\nTherefore, Rc2 is checkmate.\n\n**UCI Move:**\n[RESULT] h2c2 [/RESULT]",

This delivers checkmate because:\n1. The new queen attacks the king on c8.\n2.
