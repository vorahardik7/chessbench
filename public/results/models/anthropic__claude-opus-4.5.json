Wait, let me check - if Qg2+, the King on h2 has h1, h3 as potential escape squares. h1 is available, so not mate.\n\n2. Qg1+ - Check on g1. The King on h2 could go to h3. Not mate.\n\n3. Qh4+ - Check on h4. King on h2 could go to g1, g2. Not mate.\n\n4. Qh5+ - Check. King could go to g1, g2, g3. Not mate.\n\n5. Qg3+ - Check on g3. King on h2 could take the Queen (Kxg3) or go to h1.

If Qg2+, the King is on h2. Can it go to h1? Yes. Can it go to h3? Yes. So not mate.\n\nWhat about Qh4+? King on h2, Queen checks from h4. King can go to g1 (yes), g2 (yes, but wait - is g2 protected?). Not mate.\n\nLet me try Qg1+. King on h2, Queen on g1 gives check. King can go to h3. Not mate.\n\nWhat about Qf6? Not check.\n\nQh5+? King on h2, Queen on h5 checks along the h-file. King can escape to g1, g2, g3. Not mate.\n\nQh6+? Same issue.\n\nWait - Qg3+! If Queen goes to g3, that's check. King on h2... can go to h1. But wait, is h1 covered? No. Not mate.\n\nLet me try Qf4+. Check. King escapes.\n\nWhat about Qg2+? Actually, if Qg2 is checkmate... King on h2, Queen on g2. That's check. King can go to h1 (is h1 available? Yes). Not mate.\n\nHmm, let me try Qh5+. No, King escapes to g3.\n\nWhat about Qe3? Threatens Qg1#. But that's not mate in 1.\n\nWait - Qg1#! Let me verify. Queen on g1, King on h2. Is this check? The Queen on g1 attacks h2 diagonally? No, g1 to h2 is a diagonal (one square). Yes! So Qg1+ is check. Can the King escape? \n- Kh3? Is h3 available? Yes, h3 is not attacked by the Queen on g1.\n\nHmm, not mate.\n\nLet me try Qf2+. Queen on f2 checks King on h2? f2 to h2 is along the 2nd rank. Yes, check! Can King escape to g1? g1 is attacked by Qf2. Can King go to g3? g3 is attacked by Qf2. Can King go to h1? h1 is not attacked by Qf2. So King escapes to h1.\n\nWhat about Qh4#?

Let me see if it's checkmate:\n   - The queen on d6 would attack e7\n   - The king can't go to f8 (blocked by the knight on e5 controlling f7, and queen would control f8)\n   - The king can't go to e8 (queen controls d8 and e8)\n   - The king can't go to f6 (knight on e5 controls f7, and queen on d6 controls f6)\n   - The king can't go to d8 (queen controls d8)\n   - Can the queen be captured? The bishop on b6 doesn't reach d6. The queen on d8 doesn't reach d6.\n   - Wait, can the king go to f7? The knight on e5 doesn't control f7 directly... let me check. Knight on e5 controls: d3, f3, c4, g4, c6, g6, d7, f7. Yes! The knight controls f7.\n   - Can the king go to e6? The queen on d6 would control e6, and the knight controls e6 as well? No, knight on e5 controls d7, f7, c6, g6, d3, f3, c4, g4. Not e6. But the queen on d6 controls e6.\n   \n   So after Qd6+:\n   - Ke8 is blocked by queen controlling e8\n   - Kf8 - queen controls f8 from d6? No, d6 to f8 is not a diagonal or straight line.

The knight on e5 controls d7 but not d6. So Kd6 might be possible.\n   - Actually wait, if Qf7+ then Kd8 or Kd6 could be escapes.\n\n3. **Nf7+** - Fork/check? No, this doesn't give checkmate.\n\n4. **Nd7+** - This would be check. Let me analyze:\n   - Knight on d7 checks the king on e7\n   - Can the king escape? Ke8, Ke6, Kf8, Kf6\n   - This isn't mate.\n\n5. **Qd6#** - Let me recheck this more carefully:\n   - Queen on d6 gives check to king on e7\n   - Kf8: Queen doesn't control f8 from d6... so this escapes.\n\n6. **Qf5** - Not a check.\n\n7. **Nc6+** - Double check with discovered attack? No, the queen is on d5, not behind the knight.\n\n8. **Nxd7** - This would be check (discovered check from queen? No, queen is on d5, knight moving to d7 doesn't discover check).\n\nLet me reconsider **Qd6+**:\n- From d6, queen controls: d7, d8, e6, f6, c6, b6, a6, c7, b8, e7, f8? No, d6-e7-f8 is a diagonal, so yes!\n- So Kf8 is not possible because Qd6 controls f8!\n- Kd8 - queen controls d8\n- Ke8 - queen controls e8? d6-e7-e8? No. d6-e6-e8? No. d6 to e8 is not on a line.",

No, the Rook on h1 doesn't control c2\n\nWait, I need to recheck. After Rh1+, can the King go to c2? c2 is not on the h-file or 1st rank, so the Rook doesn't control it. But is c2 controlled by the White King? The King on e3 controls d2, d3, d4, e2, e4, f2, f3, f4. Not c2.\n\nSo Rh1+ allows Kb2 or Kc2.

Kd2 or Kd3?\n- Kd2 gives... the King on c1 could go to b1, b2, c2 (blocked by Kd2? No)\n\nActually, Kd2 puts the King adjacent to c1, controlling b1, b2, c",

The Rook on f4 can't reach f2, the Queen on f3 can't capture on f2, the Bishop on b3 doesn't control f2.\n\nSo e4f2 (Nf2#) appears to be checkmate!\n\nLet me verify:\n- Knight moves from e4 to f2, giving check\n- h1 King has no escape squares (g1 covered by h2 pawn, g2 would still be in check from Knight)\n- Nothing can capture the Knight on f2\n- Nothing can block\n\nYes, Nf2 is checkmate!\n\n[RESULT]e4f2[/RESULT]",
