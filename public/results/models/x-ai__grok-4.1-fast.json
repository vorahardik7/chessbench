White's king on e3 covers d2, and other escapes are controlled by the rook itself. Black's bishop and pawns lack resources to intervene or capture.\n\n### Tactical Theme\nBack-rank mate.\n\n### Forcing Checkmate Sequence\nWhite plays Rh1 (h2h1), placing the black king in check along the empty first rank. Black cannot capture the distant rook, cannot interpose on the clear line (d1-e1-f1-g1 empty, no black piece can reach them), and all king escapes (b1, d1 attacked by rook; d2 attacked by white king; b2/c2 unavailable due to pawn on b3 controlling the area and no safe flight).\n\n[RESULT] h2h1 [/RESULT]",
